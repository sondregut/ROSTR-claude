# OptimizedImage Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The app was showing numerous OptimizedImage errors when trying to load images from stale iOS container paths. These paths become invalid when the app is reinstalled or the container ID changes.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Replaced OptimizedImage with React Native Image Component
Replaced the custom OptimizedImage component (which uses expo-image) with React Native's built-in Image component in all these files:
- `components/ui/cards/RosterCard.tsx`
- `components/ui/cards/DateCard.tsx`
- `components/ui/cards/PlanCard.tsx`
- `components/ui/cards/ProfileCard.tsx`
- `components/ui/Avatar.tsx`
- `components/ui/feed/InlineComments.tsx`
- `app/person/[personName].tsx`

### 2. Created Image Cleanup Script
Created `scripts/cleanup-roster-images.js` that:
- Connects to Supabase database
- Finds all roster entries with photos array
- Identifies and removes stale iOS container paths
- Can run in preview mode with `--preview` flag

### 3. Implemented Image Validation Utility
Created `utils/imageValidation.ts` with functions to:
- `isLocalImageUri()` - Check if URI is a local file path
- `isStaleImagePath()` - Detect stale iOS container paths
- `validateLocalImageUri()` - Validate if local file exists
- `cleanupStaleImagePaths()` - Remove stale paths from array

### 4. Updated Components to Use Validation
- **RosterContext**: Now cleans stale image paths when loading roster entries
- **AddPersonModal**: Cleans stale paths before displaying photos

## Results
- No more OptimizedImage errors in console
- Images fail gracefully if file doesn't exist
- Stale image paths are automatically cleaned up
- All profile photos now use local URIs (confirmed via check-image-uris.js)

## How to Use

### Run cleanup on roster images:
```bash
# Preview what would be cleaned
node scripts/cleanup-roster-images.js --preview

# Actually clean stale paths
node scripts/cleanup-roster-images.js
```

### Check user profile images:
```bash
node scripts/check-image-uris.js
```

## Notes
- React Native's Image component handles missing files more gracefully than expo-image
- Local file URIs are now validated before display
- The cleanup happens automatically when data is loaded from the database
