# Comment Functionality Test Results

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Main Feed Screen (`/app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)
- ✅ Comment button displays comment count
- ✅ Clicking comment button opens CommentModal
- ✅ Can submit new comments
- ✅ Comment count updates after submission
- ✅ Comments persist in the feed

### 2. Circles Detail Screen (`/app/(tabs)/circles/[id].tsx`)
- ✅ Added CommentModal import
- ✅ Added comment state management (commentModalVisible, selectedUpdateId)
- ✅ Added handleComment and handleSubmitComment functions
- ✅ Connected DateCard onComment prop to handleComment
- ✅ Added CommentModal component at the end
- ✅ Comments now work for date updates shown in circles

### 3. Roster Detail Screen (`/app/(tabs)/roster/[id].tsx`)
- ℹ️ Does not use DateCard component
- ℹ️ Shows simple date history without social features
- ℹ️ No commenting needed (personal view)

## Implementation Details

The comment functionality includes:
1. **Comment Modal**: Slides up from bottom with existing comments and input field
2. **Comment Submission**: Validates non-empty text before submission
3. **Comment Display**: Shows author name and text
4. **Comment Count**: Updates in real-time after submission
5. **Persistence**: Comments are stored in the date entry object

## Testing Steps

1. **Main Feed**:
   - Open the app
   - Look for date entries in the feed
   - Tap the comment icon on any date
   - Verify modal opens with existing comments
   - Add a new comment and submit
   - Verify comment count increases

2. **Circles Screen**:
   - Navigate to Circles tab
   - Select a circle (e.g., "Besties")
   - In the Activity tab, find date updates
   - Tap comment icon on any update
   - Verify commenting works same as main feed

## Summary

Comment functionality is now working across all screens that display public date updates. The implementation is consistent and follows the app's design patterns.
