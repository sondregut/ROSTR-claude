```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.your-service-role-key-here...
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: The service role key has admin privileges. Keep it secret and never commit it to git!

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Environment Variables
If you see this error:
```
Missing required environment variables:
  - SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
```

**Solution**: Add your service role key to `.env`:
```env
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key-here
```

### Authentication Error
If you see HTTP 401/403 errors:
```
Failed to create bucket: HTTP 401
```

**Solution**: 
- Verify you're using the **service_role** key, not the anon key
- Check that the key is correctly copied (no extra spaces/characters)

### Bucket Already Exists
If you see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Bucket 'user-photos' already exists, skipping...
```

**This is normal!** The script safely skips existing buckets.

### Network/Connection Issues
If you see connection errors:
```
Script failed: connect ECONNREFUSED
```

**Solution**:
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your Supabase URL is correct
- Ensure Supabase service is available

## Manual Alternative

If the script fails, you can create buckets manually:

1. Go to **Storage** in your Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **"New bucket"**
3. Use the specifications listed above for each bucket

## Security Notes

- The service role key has full admin access to your Supabase project
- Never commit this key to version control
- Consider using environment-specific keys for different deployments
- Rotate keys regularly for production applications

## Next Steps

After running this script successfully:

1. ‚úÖ Your storage buckets are configured
2. ‚úÖ Your database schema is set up
3. ‚úÖ RLS policies are active
4. ‚úÖ Your backend is production-ready!

You can now:
- Test file uploads in your app
- Start developing features that use storage
- Deploy your app with confidence
