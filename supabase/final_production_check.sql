-- Final Production Check & Fix
-- Run this after the migration to ensure everything is ready

-- 1. Check which 3 tables don't have RLS
SELECT 'Tables WITHOUT RLS (need fixing):' as check;

FROM pg_tables 
WHERE schemaname = 'public' 
AND rowsecurity = false;

-- 2. Check critical realtime tables

-- 3. Quick enable RLS on remaining tables
