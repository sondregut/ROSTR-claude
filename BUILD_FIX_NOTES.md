# Build Fix Notes - August 1, 2025

## Issue 1: EAS Build Warnings
EAS Build 33fd040e failed with expo doctor warnings:
1. Package version mismatch: `@react-native-community/datetimepicker@8.4.3` (expected 8.4.1)
2. Prebuild configuration conflicts (native folders present with app.json config)
3. New Architecture incompatibility warnings for OTP packages

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Package Version
- Ran `npx expo install --fix` to update `@react-native-community/datetimepicker` from 8.4.3 to 8.4.1
- This resolved the Expo SDK 53 compatibility issue

### 2. Remaining Non-Critical Warnings
The following warnings remain but don't block the build:

**Prebuild Configuration**: 
- The project has native folders (`ios/` and `android/`) with native config in app.json
- This is expected for bare workflow projects with custom native code
- No action needed unless switching to managed workflow

**New Architecture Incompatibility**:
- `react-native-otp-verify` doesn't support New Architecture
- Not critical since `newArchEnabled: false` in app.json
- Consider alternatives if planning to enable New Architecture

## Issue 2: Production Build Crash (Build 9f32e6d3)
Production build succeeded but app crashed on launch due to missing environment variables.

### Root Cause
- Environment variables defined in eas.json weren't accessible in the app
- The config/env.ts file couldn't read variables from Constants.expoConfig.extra
- Missing babel-plugin-inline-dotenv for production builds

### Solution Applied

1. **Converted app.json to app.config.js**
   - Enables dynamic configuration
   - Added environment variables to the `extra` field
   - Variables now accessible via Constants.expoConfig.extra

2. **Updated babel.config.js**
   - Added babel-plugin-inline-dotenv plugin
   - Ensures environment variables are inlined during production builds

3. **Verified .env.production exists**
   - Contains all required production environment variables
   - Properly formatted with EXPO_PUBLIC_ prefix

## Issue 3: Expo Router Build Failure (Build ecd68273)
Build failed with babel-plugin-inline-dotenv conflicting with expo-router.

### Root Cause
- babel-plugin-inline-dotenv was replacing ALL process.env references
- This broke expo-router's require.context which needs `process.env.EXPO_ROUTER_APP_ROOT`
- Error: "First argument of require.context should be a string denoting the directory to require"

### Solution Applied

1. **Removed babel-plugin-inline-dotenv**
   - Not needed with modern Expo's built-in environment handling
   - Was causing conflicts with expo-router

2. **Rely on Expo's native environment handling**
   - Environment variables from eas.json are properly passed
   - app.config.js exposes them via the `extra` field
   - config/env.ts reads from Constants.expoConfig.extra

## Verification
- Successfully built and ran on iOS simulator with `npx expo run:ios`
- Tested production mode locally with `npx expo start --no-dev`
- Environment variables properly loaded in production configuration

## Issue 4: Migration to Managed Workflow
Migrated from bare to managed workflow to fix configuration issues and environment variable handling.

### Changes Applied

1. **Removed native folders**
   - Deleted `/ios` folder (contained only Expo-generated code)
   - No `/android` folder existed

2. **Updated .gitignore**
   - Added `/ios` and `/android` to prevent tracking generated code
   - Reduces repository size by ~40MB

3. **Suppressed package warnings**
   - Added expo.doctor exclusions in package.json for OTP packages
   - All expo doctor checks now pass (15/15)

### Benefits
- ✅ EAS Build will properly generate native code from app.config.js
- ✅ Environment variables properly embedded in production builds
- ✅ Icons, splash screens, and native settings sync correctly
- ✅ No more prebuild configuration warnings
- ✅ Cleaner repository without generated code

## Verification
- Successfully ran `npx expo prebuild --clean`
- All expo doctor checks pass
- Ready for production build

## Next Steps
1. Create new production build with `eas build --platform ios --profile production`
2. Test the new build thoroughly - environment variables should work correctly
3. Submit to App Store once verified
