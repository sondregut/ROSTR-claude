- **EAS Project ID:** bda19927-debe-46ff-a855-28e21348c0de

## Step 1: Build for Production

First, let's create a production build for TestFlight:

```bash
# Build for iOS production (this will auto-increment build number)
eas build --platform ios --profile production
```

This will:
- Create a production `.ipa` file
- Auto-increment the build number (handled by EAS)
- Use production environment variables
- Apply all optimizations and minification
- Take about 15-30 minutes

## Step 2: Submit to TestFlight

Once the build is complete, submit it:

```bash
# Submit the latest iOS build to TestFlight
eas submit --platform ios --latest
```

Or if you want to specify a particular build:

```bash
# List recent builds
eas build:list --platform ios --limit 5

# Submit specific build
eas submit --platform ios --id=[build-id]
```

## Step 3: Configure in App Store Connect

1. Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com)
2. Select your app "RostrDating"
3. Go to "TestFlight" tab

### Internal Testing (Immediate)
